# Bachelor-Thesis
Simple test apps made as part of my research into performance diffrences between Flutter, React Native &amp; native Android.

# The test applications
There are 3 diffrent test senarios for each framework and also three for native Android. Each has a short summary of what I aimed to test with it.

### List test (word list):
This test senario was aimed at seeing how well the codebase can keep up with animating a list that's being rapidly scrolled trough.
